### TODO:
- [x] MessageQueue separate into event and push.
  - The event queue is used for business logic.
  - The push queue is used to send messages to users
      - It can be non-persistent (e.g., Redis stream)
      - Streamed fragments of AI responses
          - No need for long-term storage (a complete copy should exist in the event queue)
          - Not convenient for the recipient to extract the content
- [ ] webhook
    - receive messages via WebSocket and send them to the main queue, or access other services through a **webhook**
    - event map
    - history srv
    - hot reload config
- [ ] channel/chatroom

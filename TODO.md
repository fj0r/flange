### TODO:
- [x] MessageQueue separate into event and push.
  - The event queue is used for business logic.
  - The push queue is used to send messages to users
      - It can be non-persistent (e.g., Redis stream)
      - Streamed fragments of AI responses
          - No need for long-term storage (a complete copy should exist in the event queue)
          - Not convenient for the recipient to extract the content
- [x] webhook
    - [x] receive messages via WebSocket and send them to the main queue, or access other services through a **webhook**
    - [x] event map
    - [ ] ~history srv~
    - [x] ~hot reload config~ config update api
- [ ] ~topic/channel/chatroom~ (client/controller)
- [x] top event (unachievable)
- [x] greet
    - [x] init ui
    - [x] template
    - [x] webhook
- [x] auth/login
    - [x] webhook
    - [x] event (replace session)
        - [ ] update session_id after the message queue login event
